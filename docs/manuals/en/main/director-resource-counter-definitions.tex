\defDirective{Dir}{Counter}{Catalog}{}{}{%

}

\defDirective{Dir}{Counter}{Description}{}{}{%
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Counter}{Maximum}{}{}{%
This is the maximum value  value that the counter can have. If not specified
or set to  zero, the counter can have a maximum value of 2,147,483,648  (2 to
the 31 power). When the counter is incremented past  this value, it is reset
to the Minimum.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Counter}{Minimum}{}{}{%
This specifies the minimum  value that the counter can have. It also becomes
the default.  If not supplied, zero is assumed.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Counter}{Name}{}{}{%
The name of the Counter.  This is the name you will use in the variable
expansion  to reference the counter value.
}

\defDirective{Dir}{Counter}{Wrap Counter}{}{}{%
If this value  is specified, when the counter is incremented past the
maximum and thus reset to the minimum, the counter specified on the  
\linkResourceDirective{Dir}{Counter}{Wrap Counter}
is incremented. (This is currently not implemented).
