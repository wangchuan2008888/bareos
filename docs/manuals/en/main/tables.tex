The status of a Bareos job is stored as abbreviation 
in the Catalog database table Job.
It is also displayed by some bconsole commands, eg. \bcommand{list}{jobs}.

This table lists the abbreviations together with its description and weight.
The weight is used, when multiple states are applicable for a job. 
In this case, only the status with the highest weight/priority is applied.

\begin{longtable}{ | c | l | r | }
