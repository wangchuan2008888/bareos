.. _LanAddress:

Using different IP Adresses for SD â€“ FD Communication
=====================================================

:index:`[TAG=Lan Address] <single: Lan Address>`

Bareos supports network topologies where the |bareosFd| and |bareosSd| are situated inside of a LAN, but the |bareosDir| is outside of that LAN in the Internet and accesses the |bareosFd| and |bareosSd| via SNAT / port forwarding.

Consider the following scheme:

.. code-block:: sh

      /-------------------\
      |                   |    LAN 10.0.0.1/24
      |                   |
      |  FD_LAN   SD_LAN  |
      |  .10         .20  |
      |                   |
      \___________________/
                |
            NAT Firewall
            FD: 8.8.8.10 -> 10.0.0.10
            SD: 8.8.8.20 -> 10.0.0.20
                |
      /-------------------\
      |                   |
      |                   |     WAN / Internet
      |        DIR        |
      |     8.8.8.100     |
      |                   |
      | FD_WAN   SD_WAN   |
      | .30         .40   |
      \___________________/

The |bareosDir| can access the :strong:`FD_LAN` via the IP 8.8.8.10, which is forwarded to the IP 10.0.0.10 inside of the LAN.

The |bareosDir| can access the :strong:`SD_LAN` via the IP 8.8.8.20 which is forwarded to the IP 10.0.0.20 inside of the LAN.

There is also a |bareosFd| and a |bareosSd| outside of the LAN, which have the IPs 8.8.8.30 and 8.8.8.40

All resources are configured so that the :strong:`Address` directive gets the address where the |bareosDir| can reach the daemons.

Additionally, devices being in the LAN get the LAN address configured in the :strong:`Lan Address` directive. The configuration looks as follows:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/client/FD\_LAN.conf

   Client {
      Name = FD_LAN
      Address = 8.8.8.10
      LanAddress = 10.0.0.10
      ...
   }

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/client/SD\_LAN.conf

   Storage {
      Name = SD_LAN
      Address = 8.8.8.20
      LanAddress = 10.0.0.20
      ...
   }

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/client/FD\_WAN.conf

   Client {
      Name = FD_WAN
      Address = 8.8.8.30
      ...
   }

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: bareos-dir.d/client/SD\_WAN.conf

   Storage {
      Name = SD_WAN
      Address = 8.8.8.40
      ...
   }

This way, backups and restores from each |bareosFd| using each |bareosSd| are possible as long as the firewall allows the needed network connections.

The |bareosDir| simply checks if both the involved |bareosFd| and |bareosSd| both have a :strong:`Lan Address` (**Lan Address**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\  and **Lan Address**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Storage`\ ) configured.

In that case, the initiating daemon is ordered to connect to the :strong:`Lan Address` instead of the :strong:`Address`. In active client mode, the |bareosFd| connects to the |bareosSd|, in passive client mode (see :ref:`PassiveClient`) the |bareosSd| connects to the |bareosFd|.

If only one or none of the involved |bareosFd| and |bareosSd| have a :strong:`Lan Address` configured, the :strong:`Address` is used as connection target for the initiating daemon.
