Passive Clients
===============

The normal way of initializing the data channel (the channel where the backup data itself is transported) is done by the |bareosFd| (client) that connects to the |bareosSd|.

In many setups, this can cause problems, as this means that:

-  The client must be able to resolve the name of the |bareosSd| (often not true, you have to do tricks with the hosts file)

-  The client must be allowed to create a new connection.

-  The client must be able to connect to the |bareosSd| over the network (often difficult over NAT or Firewall)

By using Passive Client, the initialization of the datachannel is reversed, so that the storage daemon connects to the |bareosFd|. This solves almost every problem created by firewalls, NAT-gateways and resolving issues, as

-  The |bareosSd| initiates the connection, and thus can pass through the same or similar firewall rules that the director already has to access the |bareosFd|.

-  The client never initiates any connection, thus can be completely firewalled.

-  The client never needs any name resolution and is totally independent from any resolving issues.

Usage
-----

To use this new feature, just configure **Passive**:sup:`Dir`:sub:`Client`\ =yes in the client definition of the |bareosDir|:

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: Enable passive mode in bareos-dir.conf

   Client {
      Name = client1-fd
      Password = "secretpassword"
      <input>Passive = yes</input>
      [...]
   }

Also, prior to bareos version 15, you need to set **Compatible**:sup:`Fd`:sub:`Client`\ =no in the :file:`bareos-fd.conf` configuration file. Since Bareos Version 15, the compatible option is set to no per default and does not need to be specified anymore.

.. code-block:: sh
   :caption: Disable compatible mode for the |bareosFd| in bareos-fd.conf

   Director {
     Name = bareos-dir
     Password = "secretpassword"
   }

   Client {
      Name = client1-fd
      [...]
      <input>Compatible = no</input>
   }
