Monitor Configuration
=====================

:index:`[TAG=Monitor Configuration] <single: Monitor Configuration>` :index:`[TAG=Configuration->Monitor] <pair: Configuration; Monitor>`

The Monitor configuration file is a stripped down version of the Director configuration file, mixed with a Console configuration file. It simply contains the information necessary to contact Directors, Clients, and Storage daemons you want to monitor.

For a general discussion of configuration file and resources including the data types recognized by Bareos, please see the :ref:`Configuration <ConfigureChapter>` chapter of this manual.

The following Monitor Resource definition must be defined:

-  :ref:`Monitor <MonitorResource>` – to define the Monitor’s name used to connect to all the daemons and the password used to connect to the Directors. Note, you must not define more than one Monitor resource in the Monitor configuration file.

-  At least one :ref:`Client <ClientResource1>`, :ref:`Storage <StorageResource1>` or :ref:`Director <DirectorResource2>` resource, to define the daemons to monitor.

.. _MonitorResource:

Monitor Resource
----------------

:index:`[TAG=Monitor Resource] <single: Monitor Resource>` :index:`[TAG=Resource->Monitor] <pair: Resource; Monitor>`

The Monitor resource defines the attributes of the Monitor running on the network. The parameters you define here must be configured as a Director resource in Clients and Storages configuration files, and as a Console resource in Directors configuration files.

.. _DirectorResource2:

Director Resource
-----------------

:index:`[TAG=Director Resource] <single: Director Resource>` :index:`[TAG=Resource->Director] <pair: Resource; Director>`

The Director resource defines the attributes of the Directors that are monitored by this Monitor.

As you are not permitted to define a Password in this resource, to avoid obtaining full Director privileges, you must create a Console resource in the :ref:`Director's configuration <DirectorChapter>` file, using the Console Name and Password defined in the Monitor resource. To avoid security problems, you should configure this Console resource to allow access to no other daemons, and permit the use of only two commands: status and .status (see below for an example).

You may have multiple Director resource specifications in a single Monitor configuration file.

\defDirective{Console}{Director}{Address}{}{}{%
   Where the address is a host name,  a fully qualified domain name, or a network
   address used to connect  to the Director. This record is required.
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Director}{Description}{}{}{%
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Director}{Dir Port}{}{}{%
   Specifies the port to use to connect  to the Director.
   This port must be
   identical to the  {\bf DIRport} specified in the {\bf Director} resource of the
   \nameref{DirectorChapter} file.
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Director}{Enable SSL}{}{}{%
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Director}{Name}{}{}{%
   The Director name used to identify  the Director in the list of monitored
   daemons. It is not required  to be the same as the one defined in the Director's
   configuration file.  This record is required.
   }

.. _ClientResource1:

Client Resource
---------------

:index:`[TAG=Resource->Client] <pair: Resource; Client>` :index:`[TAG=Client Resource] <single: Client Resource>`

The Client resource defines the attributes of the Clients that are monitored by this Monitor.

You must create a Director resource in the :ref:`Client's configuration <FiledConfChapter>` file, using the Director Name defined in the Monitor resource. To avoid security problems, you should set the Monitor directive to Yes in this Director resource.

You may have multiple Director resource specifications in a single Monitor configuration file.

\defDirective{Console}{Client}{Address}{}{}{%
   Where the address is a host  name, a fully qualified domain name, or a network
   address in  dotted quad notation for a Bareos File daemon.  This record is
   required.
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Client}{Description}{}{}{%
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Client}{Enable SSL}{}{}{%
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Client}{FD Port}{}{}{%
   Where the port is a port  number at which the Bareos File daemon can be
   contacted.
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Client}{Name}{}{}{%
   The Client name used to identify  the Director in the list of monitored
   daemons. It is not required  to be the same as the one defined in the Client's
   configuration file. This record is required.
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Client}{Password}{}{}{%
   This is the password to be  used when establishing a connection with the File
   services, so  the Client configuration file on the machine to be backed up
   must  have the same password defined for this Director. This record is
   required.
   }

.. _StorageResource1:

Storage Resource
----------------

:index:`[TAG=Resource->Storage] <pair: Resource; Storage>` :index:`[TAG=Storage Resource] <single: Storage Resource>`

The Storage resource defines the attributes of the Storages that are monitored by this Monitor.

You must create a Director resource in the :ref:`Storage's configuration <StoredConfChapter>` file, using the Director Name defined in the Monitor resource. To avoid security problems, you should set the Monitor directive to Yes in this Director resource.

You may have multiple Director resource specifications in a single Monitor configuration file.

\defDirective{Console}{Storage}{Address}{}{}{%
   Where the address is a host name, a fully qualified domain name, or a network
   address in  dotted quad notation for a Bareos Storage daemon.  This record is
   required.
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Storage}{Description}{}{}{%
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Storage}{Enable SSL}{}{}{%
   }

\defDirective{Console}{Storage}{Name}{}{}{%
   The Storage name used to identify  the Director in the list of monitored
   daemons. It is not required  to be the same as the one defined in the Storage's
   configuration file. This record is required.

   }

\defDirective{Console}{Storage}{SD Port}{}{}{%
   Where port is the port to use to  contact the storage daemon for information
   and to start jobs. This same port number must appear in the Storage resource
   of the  Storage daemon's configuration file.
   }

Tray Monitor

Tray Monitor Security
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`[TAG=Tray Monitor Security] <single: Tray Monitor Security>` :index:`[TAG=Security->Tray Monitor] <pair: Security; Tray Monitor>`

There is no security problem in relaxing the permissions on tray-monitor.conf as long as FD, SD and DIR are configured properly, so the passwords contained in this file only gives access to the status of the daemons. It could be a security problem if you consider the status information as potentially dangerous (most people consider this as not being dangerous).

| Concerning Director’s configuration:
| In tray-monitor.conf, the password in the Monitor resource must point to a restricted console in bareos-dir.conf (see the documentation). So, if you use this password with bconsole, you’ll only have access to the status of the director (commands status and .status). It could be a security problem if there is a bug in the ACL code of the director.

| Concerning File and Storage Daemons’ configuration:
| In tray-monitor.conf, the Name in the Monitor resource must point to a Director resource in bareos-fd/sd.conf, with the Monitor directive set to Yes (see the documentation). It could be a security problem if there is a bug in the code which check if a command is valid for a Monitor (this is very unlikely as the code is pretty simple).

Example Tray Monitor configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:index:`[TAG=Tray Monitor->Configuration] <pair: Tray Monitor; Configuration>` :index:`[TAG=Configuration->Tray Monitor] <pair: Configuration; Tray Monitor>`

An example Tray Monitor configuration file might be the following:

   #
   # Bareos Tray Monitor Configuration File
   #
   Monitor {
     Name = rufus-mon        # password for Directors
     Password = "GN0uRo7PTUmlMbqrJ2Gr1p0fk0HQJTxwnFyE4WSST3MWZseR"
     RefreshInterval = 10 seconds
   }

   Client {
     Name = rufus-fd
     Address = rufus
     FDPort = 9102           # password for FileDaemon
     Password = "FYpq4yyI1y562EMS35bA0J0QC0M2L3t5cZObxT3XQxgxppTn"
   }
   Storage {
     Name = rufus-sd
     Address = rufus
     SDPort = 9103           # password for StorageDaemon
     Password = "9usxgc307dMbe7jbD16v0PXlhD64UVasIDD0DH2WAujcDsc6"
   }
   Director {
