Introduction
============
This is a complete guide to the language and style conventions used for Bareos Main Reference and Documentation. The Sphinx tool has been used to produce a presentable documentation using the reStructuredText files present in ``new_main_reference/source``. The final documentation has been placed in ``new_main_reference/BareosMainReference``.
