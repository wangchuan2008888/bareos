Release 17.2.x
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bareos/bareos.png?branch=bareos-17.2)](https://travis-ci.org/bareos/bareos/branches)

* Performance improvements through denormalization of the ```File``` database table
  * The denormalization of the File database table leads to enormous performance improvements in installation, which covering a lot of ﬁle (millions and more).
  * For the denormalization the database schema must be modiﬁed. Please note! Updating the database to schema version >= 2170 will increase the required disk space. Especially it will require around twice the amount of the current database disk space during the migration.
  * The ```Filename``` database table does no longer exists. Therefore the ```.bvfs_*``` commands do no longer output the ```FilenameId``` column.
* ```NDMP_NATIVE``` support has been added. This include the NDMP features DAR and DDAR.
* Added Bareos Storage Daemon backend droplet. Most notably it allows backup and restores to a S3 environment. Included as beta. Don’t use in productive environment!
* Soft Quota: automatic quota grace period reset if a job does not exceed the quota.
* bareos-dbcheck: disable all interactive questions in batch mode.
* list files: also show deleted ﬁles (accurate mode).
* list jobstatastics: added.
* purge : added conﬁrmation.
* list volumes: fix limit and offset handling.
* [Windows: restore directory attributes](https://bugs.bareos.org/view.php?id=629)
* [Tape: ﬁx block size handling, AWS VTL iSCSI devices](https://bugs.bareos.org/view.php?id=639)
* [Support for MySQL 5.7](https://bugs.bareos.org/view.php?id=705)
* [Allow long JSON messages (has been increased from 100KB to 2GB)](https://bugs.bareos.org/view.php?id=719)
* [Virtual Backups: skip jobs with no ﬁles](https://bugs.bareos.org/view.php?id=793)
* BAT has been removed. Please use [bareos-webui](https://github.com/bareos/bareos-webui/) instead.
* Bareos File Daemon now also is ready for
  * MacOS
  * HP-UX 11.31 (ia64)

Release 14.2.x
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bareos/bareos.png?branch=bareos-14.2)](https://travis-ci.org/bareos/bareos/branches)

* Configuration engine refactoring in preparation for configuration API.
* Accurate mode refactoring
   * Data storage abstraction
   * In memory hashtable (same as previously)
   * LMDB (Lightning Memory DB same as used in OpenLDAP.)
* Python FD plugin base class abstraction for Python plugin writers.
* Added missing methods to Python FD class should now have all methods and structures that C plugin has.
* Fixed most important high level coding problems found by Coverity scans.
* Disable a client (analog to disable job but then for all jobs of a certain client.)
* Disable a schedule (analog to disable job but then for all jobs triggered by that schedule.)
* Cleanup of more global variables.
* Make scripting more robust for getting the database engine used.
* Debian packaging got major overhaul.
   * dbconfig used for database configuration on debian based distributions.
   * dh\_installinit used for init scripts on debian based distributions.
   * The LICENSE text is more inline with what debian requires for the debian packaging.
* Bug fixes to bugs found by Coverity scans.
* Added prototype of CRL (Certificate Revocation List) reload logic for openssl.
* Limit storage list to autochangers automatically when a command makes sense only on autochangers.
* Exclude Dir containting extended to allow multiple settings.

* Some tools are installed into bindir instead of sbindir now.
* Traymonitor now shows a red icon when there are connection or authentication problems with a server.
* CentOS 7 and RHEL7 support added to build system.
* Fixed several problems with copy and migration jobs to make them work better.
   * Do not cancel the copy/migration job on certain events.
   * When you configure your Copy and Migration Jobs now without a dummy client/fileset you get the following:
      * Jobs now show the actual client of the original job.
      * Jobs now show the actual level of the the original job.
      * Jobs now show the actual fileset of the original job.
   * The jobs data spooling setting is now only used when its not enabled already.
      * In the old situation the disabling of data spooling in the Job would disable a command line override to enable spooling.
   * The printing of Client and FileSet and Level is restored now they are set with sensible info.
   * Disabled checking client concurrency for Copy and Migration Jobs.
      * As the client is not contacted anyway we are now only limited by the storage concurrency.
   * Allow to read from file type devices multiple times
      * A read volume on a file type device can now be reserved by multiple jobs and when the jobs
        use the same volume they can execute at the same time when the right concurrency is met on the other resources.
* Added a prototype of a CEPHFS storage backend.
* Added support for dynamic loading of storage backends in the storage daemon.
   * File storage is always loaded.
   * Tape/GFAPI/RADOS/... can be loaded dynamically (simular to what we alread had for database backends.)
* All shared code between the different storage programs (bareos-sd, btape, ...) is now in a new shared library.
* VTAPE is removed from the code base (Use MHVTL).
* Initial support for TAPEALERT is added.
* Storage daemon statistics gathering.
* Some preliminary work for allowing to have audit events.
* Use a special backend dir to store both catalog and storage backends.
* Support for NotToBackup Registry Key on windows.
* On the packaging side we now store the bareos libs in a subdir. (e.g. /usr/lib/bareos, /usr/lib64/bareos)
* Allow multiple python DIR and SD plugins.
* Class based Python DIR plugin wrappers.
* Max VirtualFull Interval and Virtual Full Pool override.
* Syslog message destinations fixed, allow setting of syslog facility and correct log level.
* Add ability to specify server address for ADO connect string in mssqlvdi plugin.
* Refactor FileSet Options using bit operations (future readiness)

* Preliminary support for Cloud storage backends:
   * GFAPI (Gluster FileSystem) (tested simple backup and restore, needs more tests)

Release 13.2.x
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bareos/bareos.png?branch=bareos-13.2)](https://travis-ci.org/bareos/bareos/branches)

* Allow to cancel multiple jobids with cancel cmd from bconsole.

Release 13.1.x
==============

* Allow cancel by JobId on storage daemon. (#13)
* Security (filed)
   * Implementation of an allowed scriptdir keyword (#31)
   * Implementation of an allowed job command keyword (#32)
* Cleanup of compression framework (#34)
* Encryption cipher is hardcoded (#46)
* Job migration/copy between different SDs (#7)
* Use open\_bpipe wrapper in bpipe plugin (#104)
   * Side effect of using open\_bpipe is that you can only call
     a binary or a script like all other things in Bareos e.g.
     runscripts etc. If you want to use a direct cmdline you need
     to embed the cmdline in a sh -c 'cmdline ...'
* Add firewall friendly reverse data channel initialization.
   * instead of FD connecting to SD for backup, restore and verify
     the client is defined as a passive client and the Director instructs
     the SD to connect to the FD. So no need for puching holes in your firewall
     for returning data traffic but initiate all connections from the inside to
     the outside. The default is still non passive mode but for external clients
     in an DMZ or on the Internet you can define the client as a passive client.
